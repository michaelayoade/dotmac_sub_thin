"""Explicit database runtime binding for the composed Sub shell.

Posture (register S11): the runtime DSN must authenticate as a
non-superuser, NOBYPASSRLS role. Legacy Seabone Sub bypasses RLS; this
assembly is born unable to. Superuser is checked as well as the flag,
because a superuser bypasses RLS regardless of ``rolbypassrls`` (kernel
``migrations/verify.py`` makes the same point for the named roles).

Binding rules:
- ``DATABASE_URL`` absent -> no runtime (empty-shell mode; health only).
- ``DATABASE_URL`` present but blank or non-Postgres -> refuse at import.
  A supplied-but-useless DSN is a configuration defect, never a reason
  to fall back to the kernel reference runtime.
- Role posture is verified by a startup check when a runtime is bound;
  the check connects, so it runs in the lifespan, not at import.
