"""Assembly-owned readiness route for the composed Sub shell.

The kernel directly mounts DB-free liveness at ``/health`` and already
bypasses tenant resolution for ``/health/ready``, but deliberately leaves the
readiness route itself to the assembly. Mounting this route through a
``FeatureManifest`` keeps it inside ``create_app``'s post-mount validation
instead of adding routes after the factory returns.

Readiness semantics: with no ``DATABASE_URL`` declared the shell has no
data dependency and is ready. Once a DSN is declared, readiness requires
the bound runtime to answer ``SELECT 1``; anything else is 503.
